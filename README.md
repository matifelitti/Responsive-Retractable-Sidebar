This project demonstrates a responsive and retractable sidebar implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- Responsive Design: The sidebar adapts its width and content layout based on the screen size using media queries.
- Toggle Functionality: Users can expand or collapse the sidebar by clicking on the toggle button, which adjusts the sidebar's width and hides/shows certain elements.
- Profile Section: Displays user profile information including an image, name, and a toggle button for sidebar interaction.
- Search Bar: Allows users to input search queries with an icon for visual representation.
- Navigation Links: Provides links to various sections like Home, Messages, Inbox, Properties, and Logout.
- Dark Mode: Supports a dark mode feature that changes the color scheme of the sidebar and adjusts elements for better visibility in low-light environments.
